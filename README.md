# Extracting-energy-from-urban-surfaces
Main project developed during mathematical modelling subject

In this project, working in group we modeled the use of water pipes under city roads to extract energy from the surface, thereby reducing the road temperature. Initially, we modeled the temperature of a concrete structure due to the effects of solar radiation. Subsequently, we utilized that information to model the heat exchange between the water pipe and the concrete. Analytical and numerical methods were employed to primarily analyze the impact of certain parameters on the heating of the water pipe in our model: the depth of the pipe (z), the velocity of the water (u), and the radius of the pipe (R).
